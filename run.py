print ("experience I have gained by working a DTL is great but the only thing that I don't like about there is lack of organized structure in the company. I have been working there for 2 years and I have seen many people come and go. The management is not very supportive and there is a lot of favoritism. I feel like I am not growing in my career and I need to move on to a better opportunity.")
